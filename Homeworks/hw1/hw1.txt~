#Collaboration: I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

--Question #1--

1. Starting from the left, take down the first two books and compare them to ensure they are in the right order.
2. If they are not, switch them and then put them back on the shelf; if they are put them back in the order they were originally in.
3. Now pick up the book that you just put back on the right along with the book immediately to the right of it.
4. Compare them and make a switch if necessary.
5. Repeat this process until you get to the last two books on the shelf.
6. Unless you went through the whole shelf without making a single switch go back to Step 1.
7. Done.

--Question #2--

1. Open the Dictionary to the section whose letter is the same as the first letter in your word.
2. Look at the last word on that page and compare it to the word you are searching for.
3. If your word comes before the comparison word then your word is on that page, if not proceed to the next page.
4. Repeat this process until you have found the page that your word is on.
5. Now, starting from the top of the page, compare the first word to your word.
6. If not every letter matches then move to the next word on the page.
7. Repeat Step 6 until your word is found.

--Question #3--

1. Give each letter in the word a place value based on it's position in the word (starting from 0).
2. Compare the first letter in the word to the last letter in the word.
3. If they are the same, continue; If they are different, the word is NOT a palindrome and you are done.
4. If the place value that was originally at the beginning is ever greater than OR equal to the place value that was originally at the end, then
the word IS a palindrome and you are done
5. Now compare the letter one place value to the right (+) of the letter that was on the left TO the letter one place value to the left 
(-) of the letter that was on the right.
6. If the letters do not match then the word is NOT a palidrome and you are done. Otherwise loop back to step 4.
7.Done

--Question #4--

1. Open waffle mix and measure out 2 cups into a mixing bowl. (use a dry measuring cup)
2. Now add 1&(1/3) cups of water using a wet measuring cup.
3. Using a thin hard surface (a butter knife or mixing bowl edge) carefully crack an egg, pulling apart the shell and dropping
the yolk and whites into the mixing bowl. Ensure that no piece of shell got into the bowl.
4. Now add 2 tablespoons of vegtable oil and mix everything together using a wisk.
5. Make sure that no dry mix is left on the bottom or sides. Mix until large bubbles are gone.
6. Heat up waffle iron until light is green.
7. Then, using a grill brush, lightly brush a thin layer of vegtable oil onto the iron. (prevents sticking)
8. Finally pour mix out (using a serving spoon or ladle) on top of the waffle iron until the square tips of the iron are just barely poking out above the mix
9. Close waffle iron and then flip it over using the handle until green light turns off.
10. then flip iron back over, open it, and carefully remove cooked waffle using a spatula or wooden spoon.
